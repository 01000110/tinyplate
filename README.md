## tinyplate
A lightweight, responsive dashboard powered by Twitter Bootstrap. This is a fork of the [Responsive-Dashboard](https://github.com/Ehesp/Responsive-Dashboard) project but includes the following changes:

* The Angular dependency was removed.
* You can choose between a fixed or fluid width.
* When viewed on a mobile device, the sidebar has been replaced with an off canvas solution that is toggled with a button.

[demo](http://scottwoodall.com/tinyplate/)

#### installation (choose one)
1. Grab the [HTML template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottwoodall/tinyplate/master/dist/index.html) and [stylesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottwoodall/tinyplate/master/dist/tinyplate.css) from Github.
1. `npm install tinyplate`
1. `git clone https://github.com/scottwoodall/tinyplate.git`

#### usage
Use `index.html` as the starting point for your project. 

##### changing layout from fixed to fluid
The template defaults to a fixed layout. If you want a fluid layout change the CSS class on the `#wrapper` div to `container-fluid`:

##### changing colors
Make your changes in `less/variables.less` and re-compile.

#### development
1. `git clone https://github.com/scottwoodall/tinyplate.git`
1. `cd tinyplate; npm install`
1. `npm run dev-server`
1. `npm run build` creates `dist/tinyplate.css` for when you're ready to commit.

Edit the source files under `./less` and webpack will automatically re-compile to `build/tinyplate.css`. Point your browser at [http://localhost:2922/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:2922/webpack-dev-server/) to see the changes.
