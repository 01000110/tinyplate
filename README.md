# tinyplate

A lightweight, responsive dashboard powered by Twitter Bootstrap. This is a fork of the [Responsive-Dashboard](https://github.com/Ehesp/Responsive-Dashboard) project but includes the following changes:

* The Angular dependency was removed.
* You can choose between a fixed or fluid width.
* When viewed on a mobile device, the sidebar has been replaced with an off canvas solution that is toggled with a button.

### installation
* todo

### development
1. `git clone https://github.com/scottwoodall/tinyplate.git`
1. `cd tinyplate; npm install`
1. `npm run dev-server`
1. `npm run build` creates `dist/tinyplate.css` for when you're ready to commit.

Edit the source files under `./less` and webpack will automatically re-compile to `build/tinyplate.css`. Point your browser at [http://localhost:2922/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:2922/webpack-dev-server/) to see the changes.
