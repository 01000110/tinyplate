# tinyplate

A lightweight, responsive dashboard powered by Twitter Bootstrap. This is a fork of the [Responsive-Dashboard](https://github.com/Ehesp/Responsive-Dashboard) project but includes the following changes:

* The Angular dependency was removed.
* You can choose between a fixed or fluid width.
* When viewed on a mobile device, the sidebar has been replaced with an off canvas solution that is toggled with a button.
